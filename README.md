Android Application which records office crimes, built while working through Big Nerd Ranch's Android Development book

Just learning the Android ecosystem in preparation for a project

## Add Crime
Portrait mode for the crime fragment is shown below. You can add an image taken from the camera, declare someone off your
contacts list as the perpetrator, change date and time, delete the entry, and send the crime report in text through another app
